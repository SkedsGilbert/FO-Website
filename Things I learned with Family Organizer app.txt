Things I learned with Family Organizer app

1.In this $stmt->bind_param("ii", $user_id, $task_id); the "ii" is letting me know that the $user_id, and $task_id are both integers

i = integer
d = double
s = string
b = blod

2. Need to make initial commit with Git Bash to set the remote.  Testing Git Gui

3. Using `` vs '' made a difference in my DB script

4. Blowfish (a.k.a. bcrypt) hashing is for storing passwords using PHP

5. Tracking commits with GitGui for Windows does not properly track changes.

6. TEXT and BLOB is stored off the table with the table just having a pointer to the location of the actual storage.
	VARCHAR is stored inline with the table. VARCHAR is faster when the size is reasonable, the tradeoff of which would be faster depends upon your data and your hardware, you'd want to benchmark a realworld scenario with your data.

7. insert_id â€” Get the ID generated in the last query

8. In $response['apiKey'] = $user['api_key'];  apiKey is what is displayed in the json and api_key is the DB column.  I can call $response['apiKey'] whatever I want, but $user['api_key'] has to match what is in the DB.
