Testing SourceTree setup

Need to rethink how I am doing the Group_Id.  Current a user can only have one group, might be useful to have more than one group per user.

Creating a group will be similar to creating an item.

If I decide to delete items from the DB instead of just making them inactive I should use this function..
public function deleteTask($user_id, $item_id) {
        $stmt = $this->conn->prepare("DELETE i FROM items i, user_tasks ui WHERE i.id = ? AND ui.item_id = i.id AND ui.user_id = ?");
        $stmt->bind_param("ii", $item_id, $user_id);
        $stmt->execute();
        $num_affected_rows = $stmt->affected_rows;
        $stmt->close();
        return $num_affected_rows > 0;
